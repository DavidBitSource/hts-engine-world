# hts-engine-world

This software contains an integration of the WORLD vocoder (https://github.com/mmorise/World) and the hts_engine API-1.10 (http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net). It also uses functions from the Speech Signal Processing Toolkit (SPTK) (http://sp-tk.sourceforge.net/).

The main modification can be found in lib/synthworld.cpp.

Use

./configure

and

make

to create bin/hts_engine.
